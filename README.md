# Interlinked-wallet
InterLinked is a Chrome extension designed to enhance the safety of sending tokens from one account to another cross-chain. It supports support transfer of ERC20 tokens from one chain/network. The user can easily revert transactions if funds are sent to unintended recipient. It works by utilizing a smart contract to hold funds until they are claimed by the intended recipient. If the recipient doesn't claim the funds or the sender realizes that they have transferred funds to a wrong/unintended address, the sender has the ability to revert the transaction and retrieve the funds

The receiver can claim the funds and bridge them to another network by paying the desired gas fees and completing the bridging of tokens from one chain to another safely

# Source Code
The contracts and frontend code has been provided

# Experience with learning and using Axelar
## Positive 
1. Easy to use cross chain transfer of tokens
It is very easy to implement the transfer of ERC2O tokens between several chains with the help of Axelar

2. The documentation of Axelar is well written providing all the needed gateway addresses at one place

3. The example/sample codes provided are helpful for the implementation
## Negative 
1. The transfer of token takes usually around 8-10 minutes between chains which increases the time for testing
2. Currently not all chains are supported
